/*
Mango Trees

Ramu's father has left a farm organized as an N Ã— N grid. Each square in the grid either has or does not have a mango tree. He has to divide the farm with his three sisters as follows: he will draw one horizontal line and one vertical line to divide the field into four rectangles. His sisters will choose three of the four smaller fields and he gets the last one.

He wants to divide the field so that he gets the maximum number of mangos possible, assuming that his sisters will pick the best three rectangles.

For example, suppose the field looks as follows:

      . # # . . .
      # . . # # .
      . # . . . .
      . # # . . #
      # . . # # .
      . # . . . .
      
Ramu can ensure that he gets at least 3 mango trees by cutting as follows:

        . # | # . . .
        # . | . # # .
        . # | . . . .
      ------+---------
        . # | # . . #
        # . | . # # .
        . # | . . . .
